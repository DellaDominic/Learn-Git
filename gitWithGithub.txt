*******USING GIT WITH GITHUB********

INTRO

    Git repositories can be hosted using a Git hosting service like GitHub

    You can: 
        1. Host your projects on GitHub

            method 1 -> 
                create a GitHub repo first and clone that locally
                (There is no need to create/add remote origin here as it's
                done automatically in the background while cloning )
                
                local project repo <---- remote (repo on GitHub server) <---- GitHub repo
                changes to local repo  --------------(push)-----------------------> GitHub repo

                GIT COMMANDS

                1. create GitHub repo on www.github.com

                2. clone (remote linked and local repo of the GitHub repo created)
                    >git clone <https address>

                3. make changes and check status, add, commit, push (GitHub repo updated)
                    >git status
                    >git add .
                    >git commit
                    >git push <remotename> <branchname>
                        NOTE : 
                            To get remote name -> git remote -v
                            To get branch name -> git branch 

            method 2 ->
                create a local repo first, and create a GitHub repo
                and add remote and push to Github.
                (here try not to initialize a readme.md file while creating a GitHub repo
                to be able to push your local repo else have to force push it which overwrites the remote repo i.e removes the readme file)

                local project repo ------> add remote(repo on github server)----> github repo
                changes to local repo --------------(push)-----------------------> github repo

                GIT COMMANDS

                1. Initialize the git repo in the project folder
                    >git init
                2. code and make changes and check status, add, commit
                    >git status
                    >git add .
                    >git commit
                3. Create a GitHub repo on www.github.com (don't create a readme.md file or any other files)
                4. Add remote named origin (and link the GitHub repo)
                    >git remote add origin <https address i.e. url>
                5. Push local repo to GitHub
                    >git push <remotename> <branchname>
                        NOTE : 
                            Before pushing code ensure you are in the main branch and not master, else do this to rename your master branch to take the name main:
                            -> git branch -M main
                            To get remote name -> git remote -v
                            To get branch name -> git branch 
                6. make changes and check status, add, commit, push(GitHub repo updated)
                    >git status
                    >git add .
                    >git commit
                    >git push <remotename> <branchname>
                        NOTE : 
                            To get remote name -> git remote -v
                            To get branch name -> git branch
                    

        2. Contributing to opensource projects or other repositories

            Always go through the contribution guidelines mentioned in the contribution.md document of the repository you wish to contribute to, before making a contribution.

            1. Fork the project to which you would like to contribute, by clicking on the fork button on the respective repository.
            2. This will create a forked repo in your profile. Clone this forked repo by clicking on the code button and copy the https url.
            3. Use below command to clone the repo using below command:
                > git clone <url you just copied>
            4. Rename your current branch from master to main. (if required)
                > git branch -M main
            5. Make you contribution - the code changes you wish to contribute! stage, commit and push your changes.
                > git add .
                > git commit -m "give your commit message here"
                > git push origin main
            6. Now you can go to the actual repository and raise PR by clicking on the raise PR button.
