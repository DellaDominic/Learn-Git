GIT STASH

    1. Consider certain changes are been made 
    and after committing those changes certain new changes are made.
    But if you don not want to commit those changes yet 
    and have to work on something else from the previous commit, you can stash them 
    and later pop out these stashed code to your unstaged area by using:

    >git stash
    >git stash pop

    NOTE: to stash make use first all changes are staged using -> git add .
            
    2. To delete all that is in the stashed area, 
    if you do not want them to be poped later use:

    >git stash clear
